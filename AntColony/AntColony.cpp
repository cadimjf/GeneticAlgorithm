The basic flow of the ACOR algorithm is as follows. As a first step, the solution archive is
initialized. Then, at each iteration, a number of solutions is probabilistically constructed
by the ants. These solutions may be improved by any improvement mechanism (for
example, local search or gradient techniques). Finally, the solution archive is updated
with the generated solutions. In the following we outline the components of ACOR in
more details.

/*
The ant treats each problem variable i = 1, ..., n separately. It takes the value si
j of the
variable i of the chosen j-th solution and samples its neighborhood. This is done using a
probability density function (PDF). Again, as in the case of choosing the weights, many
different functions may be used.

In this work, similarly to earlier publications presenting ACOR [Socha and Dorigo, 2008],
we use as PDF the Gaussian function:
