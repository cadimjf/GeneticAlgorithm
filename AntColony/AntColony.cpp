The basic flow of the ACOR algorithm is as follows. As a first step, the solution archive is
initialized. Then, at each iteration, a number of solutions is probabilistically constructed
by the ants. These solutions may be improved by any improvement mechanism (for
example, local search or gradient techniques). Finally, the solution archive is updated
with the generated solutions. In the following we outline the components of ACOR in
more details.
